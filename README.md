# PingFederate-Deployment-Automation
This is my first baby step for PingFederate deployment.

This does the following
a) Finds and stops the PingFederate service on the server
b) Delete any existing your yourcompany*.jar files
c) Overwrite the "server" containing all the files to be directory to
the "server" folder on the PingFederate installation directory
(this )
d) Starts the PingFederate service.
